  <p id="help"> S.P.A.R.E. is the Society for Protection of Animal Rights in Egypt. It is located in Shobramant, Sakarra, on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt..
S.P.A.R.E. was founded in 2001 by Amina Tharwat Abaza and RaoufMishriky, and is the first fully Egyptian non-profit charity organization for the protection of animals (registration number 1615/2001).
Quite a large portion of their work is conducted extensively within the community through several programs to raise awareness about animal rights, to doctor sick, wounded and abused animals within the community, and to instill the notion of compassion for animals and all living creatures.
They also campaign heavily to promote better treatment of, and create awareness about, the state of animals in Egypt. We use every possible medium to reach out to the public in order to spread our message: television, press and radio. We also organize events and lectures at schools as well as public venues.
S.P.A.R.E. is an affiliated member of WSPA (World Society for the Protection of Animal Rights in Egypt), and Amina Abaza was elected Egyptian Ambassador for World Animal Day in October 2008. In June 2009, S.P.A.R.E. also joined Green People.
