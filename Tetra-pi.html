      <p id="AAA">Not all of us know about animal abuse which is to be cruel to animals. Most of people think that they have right to be use animals in there experiments or in making clothes …..etc.
        <br> Now we should think of the reasons that people say just to show that they are right and have to do so. they say that animals can transmit disease to humans, ok that’s right but also humans can transmit disease that came from the pollution they made to each other, does it give me a right to kill a human?
        <br>If I asked any one of these people who make animals suffer they will answer: NO,I can’t hurt a person. Ok ,why don’t we deal with animals like humans, just because they can’t talk? Sorry people, they can talk but with their language which we can’t understand, they can feel and they understand the mean of suffering.
